# X-Automate-Fashion-Retweets
The code you provided is a Python script that interacts with the Twitter API using the Tweepy library. Here's what the code will do:

1. It imports the necessary packages/modules, including tweepy, time, and logging.

2. It authenticates with Twitter using the Twitter API keys and secrets provided in the script.

3. It initializes a Tweepy API object, which allows you to interact with Twitter programmatically.

4. It retrieves information about your Twitter account (the account associated with the provided API keys) using `api.me()` and stores it in the `user` variable.

5. It sets a search query to 'fashion' and specifies that it wants to retrieve a maximum of 1000 tweets that match this search query.

6. It enters a loop that uses Tweepy's Cursor to search for tweets matching the 'fashion' query. For each tweet found, it does the following:

   - Attempts to retweet the tweet using `tweet.retweet()`.
   - Prints "Retweet" to the console.
   - Introduces a delay of 5400 seconds (1.5 hours) using `time.sleep(5400)` to comply with Twitter's rate limits.
   - Increments the `tweets_processed` counter.

7. If the number of tweets processed (`tweets_processed`) reaches the specified limit (1000), it breaks out of the loop, effectively ending the script's execution.

8. If it encounters any errors while retweeting (e.g., due to rate limits or other issues), it prints an error message to the console and logs the error to a file named "twitter_errors.log" using the `logging` module.

In summary, this script automates the process of retweeting tweets containing the word 'fashion' up to a specified limit while handling errors and introducing delays to avoid Twitter's rate limits. It's essential to replace the placeholder API keys with your actual Twitter API keys and secrets for the script to work with your Twitter account.
